# lang

A (soon to be) statically typed, interpreted, 
functional-first, multi-paradigm programming language.
Inspired by Haskell, Prolog, Ruby, and Python.


See the [unfinished language spec](https://github.com/Starchery/lang/blob/master/doc/syntax/syntax.pdf) for a brief overview.

## Planned features

- Algebraic data types

- Intuitive, mnemonic syntactical constructs

- Extensible types through traits (interfaces) 
  as well as subtyping (inheritance)

- Refinement types as constraints on existing 
  types to make logic errors semantically invalid

- Polymorphism
